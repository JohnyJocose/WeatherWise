# WeatherWise

WeatherWise is a weather forecasting iOS application built from scratch to showcase my skills as an iOS developer. Inspired by the design and functionality of Apple's Weather app, WeatherWise incorporates various features and enhancements to provide users with accurate and up-to-date weather information.

## Features

- **Core Data Integration**: WeatherWise utilizes Core Data to persistently store user-selected locations and their weather forecast data, ensuring a seamless and personalized experience.
- **Background Refreshing**: Implemented background refreshing to fetch updated weather data at regular intervals, ensuring that users always have access to the latest forecast information.
- **Foreground and Background Monitoring**: WeatherWise includes foreground and background monitoring to detect if the user disables or enables location services while using the app, allowing it to adapt its behavior accordingly.
- **Core Location**: Leveraging Core Location, WeatherWise accurately determines the user's current location and retrieves the corresponding weather forecast.
- **API Integration**: WeatherWise integrates with the [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com) to retrieve weather forecast data for multiple locations, providing users with comprehensive and reliable weather information.

## Project Overview

WeatherWise was developed as a personal project to demonstrate my proficiency in iOS development and showcase my ability to create polished, feature-rich applications from scratch. The project highlights my expertise in areas such as Core Data, background refreshing, Core Location, API integration, and handling edge cases effectively.

## Inspirations

The design and user interface of WeatherWise draw inspiration from Apple's native Weather app. While the visual similarities may be apparent, it's important to note that WeatherWise was developed independently, without the use of any starting code. Every aspect of the app, from its functionality to its design elements, was crafted from the ground up, showcasing my creativity and attention to detail.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the team at [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com) for providing the weather data that powers WeatherWise. Their API has been instrumental in making this project possible, and I am incredibly thankful for their contribution to the developer community.
